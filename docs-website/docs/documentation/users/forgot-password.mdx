# Forgot Password

Users can reset their passwords by providing their email address. When a user submits their email, our system will send
a reset password email to the provided email address. This email will contain a secure link that redirects the user back
to our system's password reset page. On the password reset page, the user can provide a new password. Once the new password
is submitted, our system will update the user's password accordingly, ensuring their account remains secure.
